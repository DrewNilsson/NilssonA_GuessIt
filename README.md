//Peer Reviewed by: Caroline Hana - I really liked how it would tell me how many tries it took me to guess the number, I did run into an issue where it said I guessed the number when I hadn't input anything yet, but I notified Drew and he knew what the issue was. The code was neat and clean and other then that one issue it ran well after the fix. Very creative with the try count I haven't seen something like that. Nice job Burger!!
